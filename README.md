# Flappy_bird

A flappy bird game in which the user can move the bird left and right in addition to flying up and down using the chipKIT buttons. Pipes and enemies are randomly generated to give the user a varied experience. There are three difficulties: easy, normal, and hard. The user has the ability to switch modes by using the switches on the chipKIT. The higher the difficulty, the more points the user gains when playing. In addition to this, a top 3 leaderboard has been implemented where the user has the option to write a 3 character string to save and record their name. Programmed in a UNO32 board with an LCD display.
