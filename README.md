# Flappy_bird

A flappy bird game in which the user can move the bird to the left and right in addition to jumping using the chipKIT buttons. 
Pipes and enemies are randomly generated to give the user a varied experience.
There is three different difficulties: easy, standard, and hard. The user has the ability to switch modes by using the 
switches on the chipKIT.
Higher difficulty increases the amount of points the user gains. 
In addition to this, a top 3 leaderboard has been implemented and the user has the option to write a 3 character string to save his/her name.
